Spinning up the hamster
Shovelling coal into the server
Programming the flux capacitor
640K ought to be enough for anybody
the architects are still drafting
the bits are breeding
we're building the buildings as fast as we can
would you prefer chicken, steak, or tofu?

don't think of purple hippos
follow the white rabbit
why don't you order a sandwich?
while the satellite moves into position
the bits are flowing slowly today
